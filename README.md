*A JavaScript and Plotly.js interactive dashboard*
For this project we need to create interactive dashboard to demonstrate Belly Button Biodiversity. So that we can identify the top 10 bacterial species of belly button and that way we can identify improbable species of bacteria to manufacture Synthetic Beef.

Purpose

Visualize the data for better understanding to draw some conclusions as researchers and data analysts.
The purpose of this research is to gather, identify and analyze the biological data of individuals’ navels.
The research holds data of 153 individuals and their:
Unique and anonyms ID.
Demographic information.
Belly button scrubbing frequency.
Belly button biological footprint.
Requirements

Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
Create a Bubble Chart
Create a Gauge Chart
Customize the Dashboard
The individual can find information by selecting unique ID from a drop-down menu and explore data by deep dive in their own results or compare the results to other individuals. This research is also public and easily accessible, so anyone can learn more about belly button biodiversity and explore this fascinating field.
